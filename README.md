# lights
Lights is an Android app that allows you to individually control the camera flash for any number of camera units available on your device. You can use it to turn on the front and back flash simultaneously for greater illumination. It should, in theory, also support external cameras (testing is welcome!).

## Features
* Turn on multiple LEDs simultaneously
* Support for any number of camera flashlights
* Privacy: No camera permission required

## Requirements
* Android 6.0+

## Installation
From the latest [release](../../releases), download the `app-release.apk` file and install it to your device. Android may ask you to turn off a security feature that prevents the installation of apps from sources other than the Play Store. This is only needed during installation so you can choose to turn it back on after installing the app.

The app should now be ready to use! âœ¨
