# lights
Lights is an Android app that allows you to individually control the camera flash for any number of camera units available on your device. You can use it to turn on the front and back flash simultaneously for greater illumination. It should, in theory, also support external cameras (testing is welcome!).

## Features
* Turn on multiple LEDs simultaneously
* Support for any number of camera flashlights
* Privacy: No camera permission required

## Requirements
* Android 6.0+

## Installation
From the latest [release](../../releases), download the `app-release.apk` file and install it to your device. 

NOTE: By default, Android prevents you from installing apps from sources other than the Play Store. This is a security feature. You may be asked to *allow the installation of apps from other sources* before you are able to install Lights (or any other apk file for that matter). You only need to allow this during installation and you can change it back afterwards.

The app should now be ready to use! âœ¨
